# pdf_merger

This Python script utilizes the PyPDF2 library to merge multiple PDF files into a single PDF document. It scans the current directory for files with the .pdf extension and combines them into a new file named "combinedPDFs.pdf". This functionality can be helpful for consolidating related PDF documents or creating a comprehensive file from multiple sources.

You first have to install PyPDF2 using pip install PyPDF2.
You need to have pdfs in same directory as this file.

Then run the code using python pdf_merger.py
